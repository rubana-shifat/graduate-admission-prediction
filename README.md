# Graduate Admission Prediction
Predicting chance of admission for graduate studies based on  different variables

The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions

The data is split into train and test data using sampling. A linear regression model was established using a combination of variables on the train sub-set. The predictions were carried out on the test sub-set and the accuracy is calculated using mean squared error (MSE).
